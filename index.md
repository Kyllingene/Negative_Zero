# Negative Zero

## Welcome to Negative Zero's website!

#### Group
  **Class Action Games** is a small group made by a few dudes who were bored. Our goal is
to make **interesting**, **fun** games that stay within our (limited) skillset.
For more info, [**here is our website**](https://kyllingene.github.io/Class_Action/).

#### Game
  Negative Zero is our **first project ever**. It is what **started** Class Action Games.
Our goal for the project is to make a **new**, **innovative**, **interesting** game in an
overused genre - **battle royale**. Our goal is **not to make a generic Fortnite/PUBG clone**,
for no matter how high-quality, those are normally quite boring. Our goal is to make a game
with new **mechanics**, new **looks**, new **feels**. Our goal is to think of what has been done, and
throw it out of the proverbial window. Then, we take whatever flies in.

not the contact is something to bother the rest about. 
***Spam will be reported as such and ignored.***
To give suggestions for the game, consider adding an issue on [**our repository**](https://github.com/Kyllingene/Negative_Zero/issues).
 
#### Game Info
  The game is currently in the **brainstorming stage**, and as such has no actual gameplay or mechanics made.
When developed, it will be made in [**Unreal Engine**](https://www.unrealengine.com/).
