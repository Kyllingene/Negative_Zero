# Negative Zero

## Welcome to Negative Zero's website!

#### Group
  **Class Action Games** is a small group made by a few dudes who were bored. Our goal is
to make **interesting**, **fun** games that stay within our (limited) skillset.

#### Game
  Negative Zero is our **first project ever**. It is what **started** Class Action Games.
Our goal for the project is to make a **new**, **innovative**, **interesting** game in an
overused genre - **battle royale**. Our goal is **not to make a generic Fortnite/PUBG clone**,
for no matter how high-quality, those are normally quite boring. Our goal is to make a game
with new **mechanics**, new **looks**, new **feels**. Our goal is to think of what has been done, and
throw it out of the proverbial window. Then, we take whatever flies in.
